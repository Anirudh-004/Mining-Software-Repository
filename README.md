      a) Install numpy 1.17.2
      pip instanumpy==1.17.2

      b) Install pandas 0.25.1
      pip install pandas==0.25.1

      c) Install matplotlib 3.1.1
      pip install matplotlib==3.1.1

      d) Install GitPython 3.1.0
      pip install GitPython==3.1.0

      e) Install Beautiful Soup
       pip install beautifulsoup4
       
  
## Step 2
* Run Anaconda and Open the jupyter Notebook in browser.

## Validation:

* I have automated the process which was manually done in the research paper. 
* I have looped each and every PR. Took the comments, conversations and title and analyzed each of them with the Key word to form a Root Cause and Manifestaiton which was done in research paper. 
* Identified the 3 root cause and manifestation within each type of root cause.
* Similarly each of the root cause is again carefully sorted into different category just like the authors have done in Research Paper.
